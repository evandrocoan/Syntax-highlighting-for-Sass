Thank you for installing Syntax Highlighting for Sass.

This is a Sublime Text 3 only package which purely forced on highlighting both Sass and SCSS syntax as accuracy as possible. Please take a look at the README to know what this package is capable to highlight and what to do if some syntax part is not highlighted with your color scheme.
